This is a note for improvement of data science.
Drawbacks to improve
1. Programming experience of data analysis
2. Knowledge of machine learning
3. No product of machine learning

Practical counterplans.
1. take online courses such as Coursera and Udacity
 * deep learning and reinforcement learning by Udacity
2. try Data Science Competitions such as Kaggle
3. try to make a product with any machine learning techniques.
4. apply machine learning techniques to my research.
